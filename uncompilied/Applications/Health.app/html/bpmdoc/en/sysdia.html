<h1>What do systolic and diastolic mean ?</h1><p>When the heart contracts, it pumps blood into the arteries. This is when pressure in the heart is highest. This contraction is called the systole. It is the highest figure in a blood pressure reading (SYS). After the heart contracts, it relaxes. This phase in the cardiac cycle is called the diastole. It is the lowest figure in a blood pressure reading (DIA). </p>
