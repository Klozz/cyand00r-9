<h1>How is the test performed ?</h1><p>After placing the blood pressure monitor on your arm and connecting your iOS device, the Withings application is launched and automatically switches to the blood pressure screen. In simple measurement mode, you just need to touch "Start" to launch the measurement process. The armband will inflate and adjust to the optimal level for the measurement. You can follow the changes of pressure in the armband thanks to a gauge displayed on the left hand side of the measurement screen. Once inflation is completed, the armband will slowly deflate until the result is displayed. You may experience some discomfort during the measurement. After several measurements you may feel some tingling in your arm. It is advisable to wait 1 minute between each measurement.</p>
