<h1>Is self measurement advisable for everyone?</h1><p>You should ask your doctor this question, as he knows you best. It is extremely easy to measure blood pressure, and most people can do it.  However, some overly “nervous” people become concerned and measure their blood pressure too often.  You should also be aware that if your heart beats irregularly (arrhythmia) or your arm is too big (excess weight or muscle) or too small (which is the case with some women or children), measurements will not be accurate. In this case, do not measure your blood pressure yourself.  If you have any doubts, consult your doctor.</p>
