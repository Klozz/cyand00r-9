<h1 id="using">Using the unit</h1>
<h2>How to sit correctly when taking a measurement</h2>
<p>You can take a measurement on either your left or right arm. <br />
  <br />
  Notes</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Measurement should be taken in a quiet place and you should be in a relaxed, seated position. Your back and arm should be supporter. Make sure that the room is not too hot or cold. </li>
  <li>Avoid eating, smoking or exercising for at least 30 minutes before taking a measurement.</li>
  <li>Sit upright with your back straight. Do not cross your legs. Your feet must be flat on the floor. </li>
  <li>Remove tight fitting clothing from your upper arm, and any thick clothing such as a sweater. Do not place the cuff over thick clothes and do not roll up your sleeve if it is too tight. </li>
  <li>Place your arm on a table so that the cuff will be at the same level as your heart. </li>
  <li>The gap between the chair and the top of the table should be between 25cm to 30cm. </li>
  <li>Relax as much as possible and avoid talking during the measurement procedure.</li>
  <li>5 minutes should elapse before the first reading is taken.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<p>Correct posture during measurement is necessary to get accurate results. You should also try to measure your blood pressure at the same time each day (Within 1 hour after waking up is recommended.)</p>
<p>Incorrect posture</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arched back (leaning forwards)</li>
  <li>Sitting cross-legged</li>
  <li>Sitting on a sofa or at a low table so that you tend to lean forward. </li>
</ul>
<p>These situations could lead to a higher blood pressure values due to a strain or the arm cuff being lower than the heart. <br />
  If the arm cuff is at a lower position than your heart, use cushions to adjust the height of your arm. </p>
  <a class="retour" href="#tablecontent">Back to table of content</a>
<br />
<br />
<h1 id="applying">Applying the arm cuff</h1>
<img class="image" src="bp_WITHINGS_BPM_SCREEN_3_WEB.jpg" alt="SCREEN_3" />
  <br />
  <p>You can wrap the cuff either on your right or left arm.
<ul>
  <li>Remove tight fitting clothing from your upper arm.</li>
  <li>Do not place the cuff over thick clothes and do not roll up your sleeve if it is too tight. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The cuff must be fully deflate</li>
  <li>Sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor and place your arm on a table so that the cuff will be at the same level as your heart. </li>
  <li>Turn the palm of your hand upside</li>
  <li>Apply the cuff to your upper arm so that the tube is aligned with your upper arm. The bottom of the cuff (cable side) should be approximatively 1 to 2cm above the elbow.</li>
  <li>When the cuff is positioned correctly, close the fabric fastener firmly. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Notes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Make certain the cuff fits snuggly around your arm. </li>
  <li>The cuff should make good contact with your skin. You shouldn’t be able to fit your index finger between the cuff and your arm easily, so you can pull the cuff off and on. </li>
</ul>
<p>The blood pressure can differ between the right arm and the left arm and therefore also the measured blood pressure values can be different. Withings recommends to always use the same arm for measurement. If the values between the two arms differ substantially, please check with your physician which arm to use for your measurement. <br />
  Taking a reading</p>
<p>The unit is designed to take measurements and store the measurement values in the memory of the device (iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch). </p>
<p>The unit can also be used to take a single measurement for other persons using the guest mode. The user «Guest» has to be chosen in the user list before measurement is taken. </p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>On the home screen, touch the «preferences» icon <img src="bp_prefs.jpg" alt="prefs" width="20" height="21" />. Make certain the auto mode is disabled. </li>
  <li>Press the «Start» button. The cuff starts to inflate automatically. As the cuff inflates, the unit automatically determines your ideal inflation level. This unit detects the pulse during inflation. Do not move your arm and remain still until the entire measurement process is completed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: To stop the inflation or measurement, press and release the «Stop» button. The unit will stop inflating and start deflating. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Inflation stops and the measurement is started. As the cuff deflates, the heartbeat symbol flashes at every heartbeat. </li>
  <li>When the measurement is complete, the arm cuff completely deflates. Your blood pressure and pulse rate are displayed. </li>
  <li>Unplug the blood pressure monitor from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch to see your results in advanced mode. Rotate your device to display your graphs. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Notes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Self-diagnosis of measured results and treatment are dangerous. Please follow the instructions of your doctor. </li>
  <li>Wait 2-3 minutes before taking another blood pressure measurement. Waiting between readings allows the arteries to return to the condition prior to taking the blood pressure measurement. </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="automode">Using the auto mode</h1>
<br/>
<img class="image" src="bp_WITHINGS_BPM_SCREEN_2_WEB.jpg" alt="SCREEN_2"/>
<p>
The auto mode will take three measurement separated by an interval of time in order to calculate a precise average of your blood pressure. 
<ul>
  <li>On the home screen, touch the preferences icon <img src="bp_prefs.jpg" />. Make certain the auto mode is enabled. Select the interval,between each measurement.  </li>
  <li>Press the «&nbsp;Start&nbsp;» button. The cuff starts to inflate automatically. As the cuff inflates, the unit automatically determines your ideal inflation level. This unit detects the pulse during inflation. Do not move your arm and remain still until the entire measurement process is completed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: To stop the inflation or measurement, press and release the «&nbsp;Stop&nbsp;» button. The unit will stop inflating and start deflating. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Inflation stops and the measurement is started. As the cuff deflates, the heartbeat symbol flashes at every heartbeat. </li>
  <li>When the measurement is complete, the arm cuff completely deflates. </li>
  <li>After the selected interval, a second and a third measurement will start. </li>
  <li>Your average blood pressure is displayed. </li>
  <li>Unplug the blood pressure monitor from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch to see your results in advanced mode. Rotate your device to display your graphs. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The three individual measurement results are not displayed while auto mode is taking the measurements. However, the results for each individual measurement can be displayed on your graph. </li>
  <li>Self-diagnosis of measured results and treatment are dangerous. Please follow the instructions of your doctor. </li>
  <li>Wait 2-3 minutes before taking another blood pressure measurement. Waiting between readings allows the arteries to return to the condition prior to taking the blood pressure measurement. </li>
  <li>You will have to activate the auto mode each time you want to use it.</li>
