<h1>Why not display the percentage of water in the body?</h1><p class="pre"><p>Water in the body is distributed between intra-cellular water and extra-cellular water. With conditions like pregnancy or edema, hydration of the body can vary widely. Monitoring hydration rate should be done under medical advice, which we recommend if you have any doubts.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">This is why we have chosen to not directly display the hydration rate on the Withings Wi-Fi Body Scale</p></p></div>
