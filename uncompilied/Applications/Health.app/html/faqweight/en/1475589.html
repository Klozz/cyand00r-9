<h1>What is the yoyo effect? How can I avoid it?</h1><p class="pre"><p>During a poorly controlled diet, an endless chain of weight loss and weight gain is often called "the yoyo effect".</p><p>To better understand it, you should know that when you eat, a part of the food is immediately transformed into available energy by the body, a part is eliminated and finally a part is stored in the form of fat.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">During a poorly conceived diet (if you miss meals for instance), the body will react by storing food in the form of fat in greater proportion.  This is the yoyo effect and the Withings scale, by measuring for you your body fat, will help you detect quickly and better avoid.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">It is highly recommended you refer to a specialist physician before going on a diet, as each situation is unique. </p></p></div>
