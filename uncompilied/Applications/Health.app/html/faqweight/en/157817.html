<h1>At what time of the day should I weigh myself?  And how many times?</h1><p class="pre"><p style="padding-top:5px;">It is important to always weigh yourself at the same time of the day.</p><p>The best moment is about 30 minutes after waking up in the morning, to avoid weight variations during the day due to diet, digestion and physical activity.</p><p>Ideally weigh yourself once to twice a week under the same conditions.</p><p>Long-term monitoring is more important than daily variations.</p></p></div>
