<h1>What is the body mass index (BMI)?</h1><p class="pre"><p>This index is simply defined as the weight of an individual divided by the square of his/her height, and is expressed in kg/m2.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">It is an international standard adopted by the World Health Organization, which allows the risks for health linked to abnormal weight to be evaluated (too low, or excessive).</p><p>Reference zones, or normality ranges (thinness, normal index, overweight, obesity) are thus established for each level of risk.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">Generally speaking, a BMI between 18 and 25 defines a weight normality zone, in which the risks of nutrition illnesses are minimal.</p><p>We must remember that the BMI is only an indicator, and that it doesn't take an individual's morphology into account. For example major athletes have a high BMI due to their muscular mass, without having any health problems.</p></p></div>
