<h1>Find out more about body composition analysis and fat mass measurement</h1><p class="pre"><p>While complex methods already existed in laboratories prior, the foundations of a body analysis method exploiting the body's electrical properties were laid down by Dr. A.L Thomasset in the 1970's. Known as "bioelectric impedance measurement" this technique was adapted to be integrated into the scale.</p><p>Its working relies on injecting a very low intensity current (absolutely safe and painless) in the feet, and the simultaneous measurement of the electrical resistance met by this current.</p><p>As fatty tissues are not conductive of electricity, the resistance is in proportion of the quantity of the body's lean mass.  Several equations are then used to deduce the lean mass, then we calculate the quantity of body fat by deducting the lean mass from the total weight.</p><p>Important note: the use of an impedance measurement appliance is forbidden to wearers of electronic implants such as pacemakers.</p></p></div>
