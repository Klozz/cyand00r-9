<h1>Why control your lean mass?</h1><p class="pre"><p>Lean mass is all of the muscles, bones and organs.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">It contains vital elements, water and electrolytes (approximately 73%), and mineral salts and proteins (27%). Lean mass composes the body's engines, which consume energy: it is therefore a good indicator of the potential to become thinner.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">For example, a former athlete almost always loses weight easily (having the ability to use free fatty acids via muscles during exercise).  Conversely certain people with a normal weight can have a fat mass of more than 40% of their body weight; weight loss will therefore be difficult without practicing a physical activity.</p><p>In fact, physical exercise develops your muscle mass, which increases the speed at which calories are burnt.  Increasing your muscular mass will increase your metabolic rate, which helps to reduce our excess body fat and helps you to lose weight healthily.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">The knowledge and monitoring of your lean mass are therefore important to correctly interpret a weight variation and improve your behavior.</p><p> An unbalanced diet can lead to muscular atrophy, which negatively impacts overall health.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;"> The daily rest energy expenditure, also known as the basal metabolic rate, can be estimated from the lean mass. You'll want to adjust your diet so that the number of calories consumed is in line with this number, which may decrease when consuming fewer calories but increases when you are more physically active.</p></div>
