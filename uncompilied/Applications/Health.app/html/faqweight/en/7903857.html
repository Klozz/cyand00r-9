<h1>What is a normal weight?</h1><p class="pre"><p>This notion, although widespread, is misleading:  there is no ideal weight.</p><p>Weight, depending on recent diet or hydration, can vary by several kilos in a few days.  Complex regulation mechanisms intervene and a variation of 1 to 2 kg over a short duration is not significant.</p><p>It is more suitable to define a "weight normality zone".</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) offers a standardized method to define this normality zone:  the Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated simply as the relationship of an individual's weight with the square of his/her height.  The normality zone is the range of BMI values for which the risk of nutrition-linked illness are minimal.</p></p></div>
