<h1>Why is monitoring weight not enough?</h1><p class="pre"><p>Monitoring weight alone doesn't take into account the evolution of the different compartments of our body, which have different health and aesthetic impacts.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">To control a slimming objective (loss of fat), put on weight (take on volume) or simply control your body balance and physical fitness, we can distinguish two components of our body:</p><p>- Fat mass</p><p style="padding-left:15px;">amorphous, non-vascular compartment that corresponds to the triglycerides of the fatty tissue. This mass represents approximately 15% of a man's total body weight and 23% of a woman's. The presence of fat in the body is vital, it ensures temperature regulation and represents an envelope for organs and joints.</p><p>- Lean mass</p><p style="padding-left:15px;">is all of the muscles, bones and organs. It contains vital elements, water and electrolytes (approximately 73%), mineral salts and proteins (27%). Lean mass composes the body's engines, which consume energy.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">Diet and physical activity have distinct effects on each of these compartments, and it isn't possible to interpret a weight variation correctly without their precise analysis.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">For example, some women see their weight increase during their premenstrual cycle. This variation is due to an increase in water stored in the lean mass, without there being any fat gain.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">Conversely, an intense physical activity can lead to a loss of water by sweating and therefore a 1 to 2 kg loss of weight in a few hours.  But there again, no impact on fat.  Significant variations of the fat stored will furthermore always take several weeks.</p><p style="padding-top:5px;">Finally, certain poorly adapted diets can lead to muscular wasting, without loss of fat and therefore not lead to the desired aesthetic effect. A distinct monitoring of the fat mass and the lean mass will help detect such a food imbalance.</p></p></div>
