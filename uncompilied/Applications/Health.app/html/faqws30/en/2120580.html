<h1>What is the Position Controlâ„¢ feature?</h1><p>Position Control&trade; is a patent-pending technology developed by Withings. It helps you properly position your body for a high-accuracy weight measurement. Digital scales such as the Wireless Scale usually feature 4 weight sensors and are calibrated during the production process with a load equally distributed across these sensors. For the weight measurement to reach a high accuracy level, it is important that your body weight also gets distributed equally across the scale's weight sensors each time you weigh. The Position Control&trade; feature use the scale's display to give you a visual feedback on your body position and help you reach this balanced, high accuracy weighing position. </p></div>
