<h1>What does the Wireless Scale measure?</h1><p>The Wireless Scale measures your weight and Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is relative to both your weight and height, and helps you know whether your weight is healthy for your height. It is usually considered that a normal BMI is within 18.5 and 25. Both these data are displayed by the scale and get synced with your app and Withings account. </p></div>
