<h1>Can the Wireless Scale be kept up-to-date with new software?</h1><p>Yes, Wireless Scale is a smart and updateable device. It can be updated with new software to add new features, make it compatible with new apps or devices, or fix issues our users  have reported. If you have a Wi-Fi network, software update will occur automatically at night as soon as an update is available. If you don't have a Wi-Fi network, the Withings app will advise you when an update is available and provide update instructions. </p></div>
