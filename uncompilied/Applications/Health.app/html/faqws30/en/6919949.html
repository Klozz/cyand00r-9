<h1>How do I set up a new user on the scale?</h1><p>Adding a new user to the Wireless Scale is very easy. You don't need to press any button on the scale itself. Just add a new user profile from the Withings app. The newly added user will be available on the scale after one additional weighing. </p></div>
