<h1>How can I share my weight data with others?</h1><p>From the Withings Health Mate app, you can decide to share your weight data on Facebook and Twitter, either automatically (each time you weigh or once a week) or manually when you feel like sharing a specific reading. You also have the option to share your weight data with another Withings account.</p></div>
