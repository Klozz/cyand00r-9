<h1>What if two users weigh approximately the same?</h1><p>If two or more users share a similar weight level and pattern, Wireless Scale may not be able to automatically recognize the person who weighs. In this case, Wireless Scale let you very easily select the right profile by leaning left or right while you stand on the scale. You can also assign a weight reading to the proper person from the Withings app. </p></div>
