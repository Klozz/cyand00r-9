<h1>How do I upload my readings to the app?</h1><p>There is nothing you need to do! The Wireless Scale will automatically upload your readings as soon as you step off the scale. If you do not have a Wi-Fi network, the scale will connect to your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in Bluetooth: you just need your iOS device to be in range of the scale (within approximately 20 meters). </p></div>
