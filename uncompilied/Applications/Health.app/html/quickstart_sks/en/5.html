  <p>In such case, the weight reading will appear in the &quot;Unknown measures&quot; pane of the Baby Companion app. To ensure a proper recognition in the future, please manually assign the measure to the right profile by visiting the &quot;Unknown measures&quot; pane in the app main menu. </p>
  <p>We hope you'll enjoy your Smart Kid Scale. Any additional question or issue, please visit our support page at: http://support.withings.com. </p></td></tr></table>
