<h1>What makes my butterfly grow or shrink?</h1>The healthier your lifestyle is, the more your butterfly will grow. <p>Your <strong>weight wing</strong> will grow if you weigh-in regularly and move closer to your desired weight. </p> <p>Your <strong>activity wing</strong> will grow with each new activity you log. </p> <p>Your <strong>heart wing</strong> will grow if you measure your BP regularly, preferably around the same time of the day, and if you tend toward a healthy blood pressure.</p><p>Your <strong>sleep wing</strong> will reach its maximum size if you sleep 7 to 9 hours each night.</p></div>
