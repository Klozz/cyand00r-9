<h1>How accurate is the Withings Blood Pressure Monitor ?</h1><p>In order to ensure its accuracy, the Withings blood pressure monitor has validated the ESH (European Society of Hypertension) test protocol. The ESH international protocol compares results of the Withings device with those of a mercury manometer. These results are processed and analysed in order to guarantee the medical reliability of the blood pressure monitor.  The Withings blood pressure monitor has also obtained EC medical certification (Europe) as well as FDA approval (USA) and is registered on the list of blood pressure monitoring devices of the AFSSAPS (French regulatory agency for medical devices). The Withings blood pressure monitor is accurate within ±3 mmHg for arterial pressure and ±5% for pulse.</p></div>
