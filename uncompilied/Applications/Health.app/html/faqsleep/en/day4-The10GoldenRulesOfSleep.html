			<br />
			<h3>Rule no. 1: Do not spend more than 20 minutes trying to fall asleep</h3>
			<p>20 minutes is the maximum amount of time for falling asleep. If you are still awake after 20 minutes, get up, read or watch television. It is more important to sleep well for 5 hours than to sleep badly for 8 hours.</p>
			
				<br />
			<h3>Rule no. 2: Follow your bedtime routine</h3>
			
			<p>Maintain any bedtime "routine" or habits that you may have, even if you go to bed late. These habits help your body prepare for sleep by telling your body that you are about to go to bed.</p>
			
			
			<br />
			<h3>Rule no. 3: Bedroom temperature must be controlled</h3>
			<p>The ideal temperature for sleeping well is 18°C. It is also important to aerate your bedroom before going to sleep. Your Withings Aura™ has a temperature sensor and can indicate to you if your room temperature is too high.</p>
			
			
			<br />
			<h3>Rule no. 4: Avoid hot showers before going to bed</h3>
			<p>Do not take a hot bath or shower before going bed. This raises your body temperature and delays your falling asleep.</p>
			
            <br />
			<h3>Rule no. 5: Avoid exposure to light and noise in order to sleep</h3>
			<p>Sound and light can delay your falling asleep or disrupt your sleep. Make sure to avoid exposure to noise and natural light, as well as other sources of light such as the screens of electronic devices. Your Withings Aura™ has a light and noise sensor that indicates when there is too much light and noise in your bedroom.</p>
			
            <br />
			<h3>Rule no. 6: Avoid overeating at dinner</h3>
			<p>Avoid eating large meals before going to sleep, particularly meals rich in meat that increase brain activity and could wake you up in the middle of the night. On the other hand, sugar induces drowsiness: enjoy herbal tea or hot milk before going to bed. </p>
			
            <br />
			<h3>Rule no. 7: Be active during the day</h3>
			<p>Being physically active during the day will help you sleep. However, be careful to allow a period of at least 4 hours between your last physical activity and your bedtime. Otherwise you might find exercise has the opposite effect and disrupts your sleep.</p>
			
            <br />
			<h3>Rule no. 8: Maintain regular sleep patterns</h3>
			<p>Try to develop regular times for going to bed and waking up. This trains your body to follow a consistent routine and you will sleep better.</p>
			
            <br />
			<h3>Rule no. 9: Wake up with light</h3>
			<p>Exposure to natural or artificial light helps you to wake up. This is one of the features your AURA uses to help you wake up gently.</p>
			
            <br />
			<h3>Rule no. 10: Warm up when you wake up</h3>
			<p>When you wake up, warm up. The body cools down during the night and you need to warm it up in order to wake up properly.</p>
