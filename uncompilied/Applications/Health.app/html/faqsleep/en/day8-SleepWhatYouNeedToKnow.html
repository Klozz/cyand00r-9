			<h3>Slow wave sleep</h3>
			<p>Slow wave sleep is divided into 4 stages of increasing depth of sleep.</p>

<p>Stages 1 and 2: 50% of total sleep, i.e. 4 hours per night. In your sleep graph, these stages are shown in light blue.</p>
<p>Stage 1 corresponds to the falling asleep phase during which we are neither completely asleep nor completely awake. Body movements are sporadic.</p>
<p>Stage 2 corresponds to a light sleep phase during which we have dreams that make us feel we are awake. We are asleep, but can be woken up by light noise.</p>

<p>Stages 3 and 4 represent approximately 25% of total sleep, i.e. 2 hours per night. In your sleep graph, these stages are shown in dark blue.</p>

<p>They correspond to a very deep sleep, where the person is completely still. There is very little brain activity or reaction to external stimuli. Pulse and breathing are slow and regular, and the face expressionless. Deep sleep is where the body regenerates from physical tiredness.
</p>
			
			
			<h3>REM</h3>
			
			<p>REM is the sleep stage during which we dream. In your sleep graph, this stage is shown in very light blue. This stage allows a person to recover from psychological fatigue and stress. <p>It follows deep sleep and represents 20% to 25% of total sleep, i.e. nearly 2 hours per night.</p> 
            <p>In REM, your face moves and is expressive. Although your eyelids are closed, your eyes move rapidly under the lids, which indicates intense brain activity that corresponds to dreaming. It is common to wake up suddenly in the morning at the end of a phase of REM sleep.</p>
