			<p>These are the 3 most frequently asked sleep-related questions. </p>

			<h3>Why don't I always get the same amount of deep sleep?</h3>
			<p>The duration of deep sleep does not depend on the length of time you sleep.</p> 
            <p>The amount of deep sleep you get depends on the intensity of your activity during the day preceding your night of sleep. For example, significant physical activity increases the amount of deep sleep. Inversely, after a nap in the afternoon, the amount of deep sleep decreases, and the amount of light sleep increases.</p> 
            <p>However, when we lack sleep, we first catch up on deep sleep. The proportion of deep sleep in a night decreases with age, as the amount of light sleep increases. Hence older people often have the impression of "sleeping badly".</p>
			
			<br />
			<h3>Why does my amount of REM sleep vary?</h3>
			<p>The duration of REM sleep depends entirely on the total duration of your night of sleep: "The longer you sleep, the more you dream." When lacking sleep, we only catch up on REM sleep once we have completely caught up with our deep sleep. </p>
			
			
			<br />
			<h3>Why do I have phases of waking up during the night?</h3>
			<p>Even if you sleep well, you wake up during the night: we change positions approximately 3 times a night. These arousals generally occur at the end of a cycle, when transitioning from an REM sleep phase to a new deep sleep phase.</p> 
            <p>If there is no stimulation at this time, we go back to sleep and start a new sleep cycle.</p>
