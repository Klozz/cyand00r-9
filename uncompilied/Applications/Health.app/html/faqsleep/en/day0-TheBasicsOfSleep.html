			<h3>What is sleep? Why do we need to sleep?</h3>
			<p>Sleep is something that you spend one third of your life doing. It is a vital bodily function, like breathing or digestion. It plays an important role in learning, memorization and adaptability. It is also essential to your overall well-being.</p>
			
			
			<h3>When should I go to bed?</h3>
			<p>The urge to go to bed is usually felt at night, around the same time every day. You begin to feel tired or cold, or experience a decrease in mental activity. If you go to bed at that time, you will fall asleep quickly, usually in under ten minutes.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>How long do we need to sleep in order to be well rested?</h3>
			<p>We are all very different when it comes to sleep. Most people need 7 1/2 to 8 hours of sleep. But some people are "short sleepers" who only need 6 hours of sleep a night or less. On the other hand, some people are "long sleepers" who need at least 9 hours of sleep a night.</p>
			
			
			<br />
			<h3>How do you know if you've slept well?</h3>
			<p>There is only one way of defining a good night's sleep: it is when you wake up feeling that you have slept well, and that you are well rested and full of energy.</p>
