<h1>What is blood pressure ?</h1><p>Arterial (or blood) pressure corresponds to the pressure of blood in the arteries. It is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).</p><p>It is expressed by two measurements: systolic and diastolic pressure. Therefore a blood pressure reading is made up of two figures, for example 122/83, where 122 represents systolic pressure and 83 diastolic pressure. These values correspond to two states of the heart: contracted and relaxed. </p></div>
